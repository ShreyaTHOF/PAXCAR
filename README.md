# Paxcar — Landing Page (V2)

Includes:
- Sponsors strip with tiers
- Team Owner reveal (modal)
- Waitlist section with embeddable providers (Google Forms/Sheets, AppSheet, Beehiiv)
- 8 team colorways + badges

## How to swap the waitlist embed
- **Google Forms → Sheets**: Google Forms → Send → Embed <> → copy iframe → replace the `src` in the Google pane.
- **AppSheet**: Share App → Embed URL → replace the iframe `src` in the AppSheet pane.
- **Beehiiv**: Grow → Embeds → copy iframe → replace the `src` in the Beehiiv pane.

## Deploy (free)
- GitHub Pages: Settings → Pages → Branch = `main` (root).
- Netlify: Drag & drop the folder.

## Tips
- Replace placeholder owner cards/logos with real assets.
- For dark logos, use transparent SVGs; keep the monochrome aesthetic by applying `filter: brightness(0) invert(1)` if needed.


Neon Theme: Colors set in `:root` to deep black + neon green/cyan with glow accents.
